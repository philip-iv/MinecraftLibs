##About
This is a repository to hold any and all utils, libs, and helper classes I make for my spigot plugins, to share with the general community. Everyone is free to use any and everything in this repository under the terms of MIT license. If you find any issues, please report them on the github issue tracker. Pull requests are welcome as well. I believe everything works on Java 7, but only Java 8 is guaranteed.

##Contents
###Annotation based Configs
An annotation system for saving and loading fields from config. Supports use of any config file, not just the default, and automatically handles their creation if they're not found. See [it's readme](src/me/philipiv/libs/config/README.md) for more info.
